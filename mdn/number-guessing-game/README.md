## What I learned
I learned that `<script type="module"></script>` is the correct syntax to load javascript files if you have a local server set up. Modules are always deferred automatically.
Alternatively, `<script defer...>` should be used if cannot set up a local server. Both ensures that the script is loaded only after HTML is fully loaded.
